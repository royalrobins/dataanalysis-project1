<h1>Data Analysis Personal Project (Microsoft's AdventureWorks Dataset)</h1>

In this project I will find the relationship of the standard cost and list price of products found in a sample dataset provided by Microsoft which is AdventureWorks. This project serves as a way to test my knowledge on ETL practices as well as experience working with databases.

<h1>Prompt: Using the Microsoft AdventureWorks sample dataset, write a SQL query to find the relationship between a product's standard cost of production and its list price based on product model. Once the data is gathered, import it into Excel to find the price increase/decrease in percentage format from standard cost of production to list price.</h1>
